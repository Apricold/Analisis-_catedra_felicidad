This is a Python code that performs clustering on three student databases using the k-means algorithm. The goal is to group students into different clusters based on variables such as (PBM, Socioeconomic Level, Age, Academic Average). The code consolidates these student databases into a single one to compare the results obtained by each cluster during happiness tests conducted at the beginning and end of the course. This allows us to observe the well-being and overall state of the students.

The databases include:

Student results at the beginning of the course
Student results at the end of the course
Socioeconomic data of each student
For this code, the following libraries were used: - scikit-learn - matplotlib - pandas - seaborn - numpy
