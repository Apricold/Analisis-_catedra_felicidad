# Student Data Analysis
This Python code utilizes the k-means algorithm to conduct clustering on three student spreadsheets. The objective is to categorize students into distinct clusters based on variables like PBM, Socioeconomic Level, Age, and Academic Average. Additionally, the code aims to pinpoint which students experienced an improvement in their overall mental health due to the course and analyze the contributing factors. By merging these student databases into a unified dataset, the code facilitates a comparative analysis of results obtained by each cluster through happiness tests administered at the course's commencement and conclusion. This comprehensive approach enables us to gain insights into the well-being and overall state of the students throughout the course

The spreadsheets are:


--> Student results at the beginning of the course

--> Student results at the end of the course

--> Socioeconomic data of each student


# Technologies
